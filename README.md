- Built-in PSG envelopes based on the [EEF](https://github.com/rhargreaves/mega-drive-midi-interface/wiki/PSG-Envelopes) format
- Supports MIDI 1.0 CCs & events (e.g. panning, volume, pitch bending)
- Polyphony via dynamic FM channel mapping
- Portamento (glide)
- Connectivity via:
  - [Mega EverDrive X7](https://krikzz.com/store/home/33-mega-everdrive-x7.html) USB port.
  - [Mega EverDrive PRO](https://krikzz.com/store/home/59-mega-everdrive-pro.html) USB port.
  - [Controller port via custom USB serial cable](https://github.com/rhargreaves/mega-drive-serial-port#hardware).
  - [MegaWiFi cartridge / BlastEm emulator](https://github.com/rhargreaves/mega-drive-midi-interface/wiki/BlastEm-&-MegaWiFi-Guide) (experimental)

## Getting Started

Head over to the [Wiki](https://github.com/rhargreaves/mega-drive-midi-interface/wiki/Getting-Started) for more information and detailed reference pages.

## Build & Test

Unit & system tests are compiled and ran as x86 binaries using CMocka. Mega Drive interfaces are mocked.

There are two flavours of ROM:

- The standard build is intended for use in EverDrives or any generic flash ROM cart.
- The MegaWiFi build is intended for use with the BlastEm emulator or MegaWiFi hardware.

The key difference between the two builds is the console header. The standard build has `SEGA SSF` as the console string in the ROM header which will instruct an EverDrive to expose its SSF API to the ROM as required for USB communication. The MegaWiFi build has `SEGA MEGAWIFI` which will instruct BlastEm and the MegaWiFi Hardware to expose the MegaWiFi APIs to the ROM.

### Docker:

Build EverDrive / Generic Flash ROM:

```sh
./docker-make release
```

Build MegaWiFi ROM:

```sh
./docker-make release ROM_TYPE=MEGAWIFI
```

### Linux without Docker

You'll need to configure SGDK in your environment accordingly and make changes to the Makefile to support building outside of Docker. I've never tried to build it outside of Docker :)

```sh
make
```
