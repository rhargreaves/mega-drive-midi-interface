- When the YM2612 regs are being changed the Z80 bus is requested. Failing tests which report "No entries for symbol __wrap_Z80_getAndRequestBus" are probably doing so as the YM2612 is being written to. For example, note on, FM parameter change.
- Do not add comments to any code added unless I ask for it. The codes meaning should be written in a manner so that its intent is self-evident.
